In this artificial intelligence project, developed in the Jupyter Notebook using Python, we utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Employing the Fashion MNIST dataset, our focus is on training GANs to generate realistic images of various fashion items. The interplay between the generator and discriminator networks enables the model to understand and reproduce diverse fashion styles accurately. This project demonstrates our proficiency in Python and Jupyter Notebook, showcasing our commitment to exploring the application of artificial intelligence in the context of the dynamic fashion landscape.
